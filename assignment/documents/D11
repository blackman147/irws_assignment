Meet Griffith's faculty and admissions teams, take a free tour of the campus and learn about our flexible payment options. Why attend an Open Day? You can read a prospectus from cover-to-cover and do plenty of research online but an open day is the only chance that you will have to look around the place where you could be spending the next few years of your life. A particular university, college or course might sound brilliant or completely uninspiring on paper - but speaking to a lecturer or student already doing the course or feeling completely at home on the college campus could change your thinking completely. That's why you should come - it's a couple of hours that could change your mind...and change your life.
