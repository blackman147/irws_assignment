Fees & Payment - Fees for all programmes/courses are due in full prior to programme/course commencement unless an approved payment plan is in place with the College. By registering on a programme/course with the College, the student remains liable for fees at that point. The fees applicable to the student will be the fees as advised in the offer letter (in the case of new academic students) and as directed by the Student Fees office (in the case of existing academic students). Fees applicable for professional programmes/short courses, will be as advised by the school/department that the programme/course is attached to. In the event that a student has to repeat a full year of a programme/course, the fee applicable will be the standard programme/course fee for the academic year in which the student repeats the year. In the event that a student has to repeat one or more subjects, the fee applicable, where a student is required to attend class for that repeat (s), is the standard subject fee for the academic year in which the student repeats the subject (s). If a student is not required to attend class and is only repeating an examination/assignment in a subject (s), the fee applicable is €120.00 per subject. Should a student commence a programme/course and subsequently withdraw or defer from the programme/course at any stage of the programme/course, full fees remain due at that point. Where a student has a payment plan in place with the College, this payment plan must be adhered to and fees remain due in accordance with the payment plan signed. Tuition fees listed do not include the cost of course materials. The cost of material differs for each programme/course and each stage. For an estimate of the cost of materials for your programme/course, students are advised to contact the Marketing office or their faculty. Course fees are subject to change each academic year. Unpaid Cheque payments and Unpaid Direct Debit payments are subject to an additional charge of €10.00. Students classified for fee purposes as fee category Non-EU on their application, shall retain that fee category for the duration of their programme. English Language - if English is not a student's native language, they must show that their English level is of a suitable standard. Students who have not achieved a sufficient score in an internationally recognised English Language Test will be required to attend the Griffith College English Language test prior to the commencement of their programme. Students whose level of English does not meet the required standard will then be re-directed onto an Academic English programme in Griffith College. The charges for these classes are additional and separate from fees already secured. All programmes/courses will commence subject to student demand. Griffith College reserves the right to change any of the details in marketing/promotional material. Where a student account is in arrears, access to certain College facilities e.g. access to Moodle, access to Computers, access to Library facilities, will be suspended. Other sanctions that may be imposed by the College, including but not limited to removal from class, non-correction of assignments and denial of access to examinations. 2. Refunds - Fees are non-refundable except in the case of visa refusal. For Non-EU International Students who are resident overseas, in the case of a visa refusal, fees will be refunded less an administration fee of €150.00. A copy of the visa refusal letter from the Irish Department of Justice must be forwarded to the International Office when requesting a refund. For Non-EU International Students already resident in Ireland, fees will not be refunded under any circumstances after the commencement of the programme/course. Where a visa is required to be renewed during the programme of study at Griffith College, it is the responsibility of the student to check with the relevant authorities that the renewal application will be approved.
