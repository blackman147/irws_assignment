How to Apply What is Blended Learning? Is Blended Learning right for me? Technical Requirements Why study at Griffith College? Award-winning study mode Finalist, Best Online Learning Experience: Education Awards 2018; Winner, Best Online Learning Experience: Education Awards 2019; Finalist, Best Use of Educational Technology: Education Awards 2020 Independent study Students often develop independence and motivation by working in their own time at their own pace. Study where you like Busy, geographically dispersed and mature students have more control over their schedules, avoiding the hassle of a daily commute. Support on and off-campus Students experience the personal engagement and support of interacting with their lecturers and classmates while benefiting from the flexibility of online delivery. Best of both worlds Because you’re still on campus once a month, you get to enjoy Griffith’s facilities and extracurriculars, as well as the sense of community with others in your course.

Apply online Contact Us What Our Students & Alumni Say We followed up with some of our current and past students to see what a difference their course at Griffith College has made to them. The blended nature of the course gave me the best of both worlds. The flexibility of the online material allowed me to balance my studies with working and raising a family, while the small class size in on-campus tutorials fostered a real sense of familiarity with my fellow students and lecturers. I would recommend this course to anybody looking to further their education but hesitant to pursue a degree through the traditional route. Nicola Hutchinson Blended BA (Hons) in Business Studies It’s the only way I could have earned a degree while still progressing in my career. By the time I finish, I’ll have a level 8 Bachelors in Business and years of experience in a global marketing company. It would have taken me seven years to achieve what I’ve gotten in four. Conor Nolan Blended BA (Hons) in Business Studies To me studying through blended learning is similar to writing. For the most part, it’s just me and my laptop, there’s no one reminding me to get the work done or of impending deadlines. I think self-motivation, determination, focus and good time management are important when considering studying through blended learning.
